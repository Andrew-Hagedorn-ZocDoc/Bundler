Tests
===
This is a suite of tests written for jasmine-node

To run you must have node installed, and the jasmine-node module.

Once installed the tests can be run on the command line in the test folder with the command ```jasmine-node .```.

For best results run the command from the top-level tests directory.  For example, to run just the unit tests:   `PS C:\src\Bundler\tests> jasmine-node .\unit\`, or to run a particular suite of tests run `PS C:\src\Bundler\tests> jasmine-node .\unit\styleguide\styleguide-spec.js`
